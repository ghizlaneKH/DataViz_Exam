Smart predictive maintenance is an advanced approach to equipment
maintenance that uses technologies such as data analysis, machine
learning,and the internet of things (IOT) to predict maintenance needs before a
failure occurs.this allows companies to plan maintenance downtimes in a
timely manner and reduce unplanned downtime, there by improving
equipment availability and overall reliability.the main purpose of intelligent
predictive maintenance is to improve the overall reliability and availability of
equipment by proactively identifying and addressing potential maintenance
issues before they cause downtime or failure.by utilizing data analysis ,machine
learning, and IOT technologies, this approach allows companies to predict
when maintenance is needed and plan accordingly, reducing unplanned
downtime and increasing equipment efficiency. Additionally, it can help to
reduce maintenance costs and increase the overall lifespan of equipment.these
Iot dashboard would give a live virtual picture of the reliability and availability
of equipment.
